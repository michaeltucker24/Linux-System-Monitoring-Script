# Linux System Monitoring Script

This project is a command-line script designed for Linux to monitor system performance, including CPU, memory, disk usage, and uptime. The script provides a snapshot of system resources, making it useful for managing and analyzing resource consumption on Linux servers.

This screenshot shows the `Disk Usage` section in `system_monitor.sh`. The script uses `df -h` to display disk usage in a human-readable format, providing information on used and available disk space.

---

### 4. Adding System Uptime Monitoring

## Usage Instructions

1. **Make the Script Executable**:
   \`\`\`bash
   chmod +x system_monitor.sh
   \`\`\`

2. **Run the Script**:
   \`\`\`bash
   ./system_monitor.sh
   \`\`\`

3. Follow the output sections to view system statistics for CPU, memory, disk, and uptime.

## What I Learned

- Using \`top\`, \`df\`, and \`uptime\` commands to gather system statistics.
- Writing interactive Bash scripts for system management on Linux.
- Applying file permissions with \`chmod\` and creating and editing scripts using \`nano\`.

This project serves as a foundation for building more advanced system management scripts in Linux. Future additions could include monitoring network traffic, memory usage trends, or active process monitoring.
